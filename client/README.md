This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

<br/>
This is my first frontend project, where I learned React and basic CSS. This is evident by the large amount of unnecessary CSS, sub-optimal state management and wrapping unecessary global context around components. 

The goal of the project is to create an application that gardeners can use to track progress at various locations within their muncipality. When I recieve updated maps, I plan to image map the different fields within a graveyard so that it's highlighted in the map when users toggle a specific field. Currently, the CSS is only optimalized for mobile screens since that is the primary use case. When the new maps arrive I will implement the necessary media queries and update the CSS to work on all devices.

**Keep in mind that the postgress DB tables need to be implemented in order for the application to work**
